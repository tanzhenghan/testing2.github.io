  <p> Some 314 species of plant jostle for space in this precious six-hectare fragment of primary tropical forest, forming a multi-layered ecosystem of herbs and ferns, climbers, shrubs, and trees. Some trees reach 50 metres in height, and were here even before the founding of modern Singapore in 1819. </p>
  <p> Among the rich species of plants found in the Rain Forest are trees of economic importance, such as rattans, fruit trees and the towering Jelutong. With more than 50 per cent of its species representing plants that are rare in Singapore, the Rain Forest certainly qualifies as a part of Singapore’s natural heritage. </p>
  <p> Open daily 7am - 7pm </p>
