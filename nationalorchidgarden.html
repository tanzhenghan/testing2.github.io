  <h3> 1) Tropical Montane Orchidetum</h3>
  <img src="nationalorchidgarden.jpg" alt="Tropical Montane Orchidetum" width="400" height="350">
  <p>The tropical Montane Orchidetum simulates the experience of ascending through a tropical montane forest and showcases a diversity of orchids and other plants (e.g. bromeliads, gingers, tropical rhododendrons, gesneriads (and magnolias) from the rich low to high-elevation montane forest. Each of the display houses within the Orchidetum has been expanded beyond their original size, increasing by almost threefold the combined display area </p>
  <h3> 2) The Sembcorp Cool House</h3>

  <p>The Sembcorp Cool House is designed to emulate a high elevation montane forest, which exists at altitudes of 1,000m to 2,000m, and with a surrounding temperature of 16 to 23 degrees Celsius. Researchers will be able to study rare orchids that are naturally found only at higher elevations, such as such as Cymbidiums (also known as Boat Orchids), Dendrochilums (also known as Chain Orchids), Cyrtochilums and Phragmipediums (also known as Slipper Orchids). This will greatly benefit taxonomic and floristic research, as researchers will be able to grow rare species, before identifying and documenting them at a later stage when they flower.  </p>
  <h3> 3) Yuen Peng McNeice Bromeliad Collection</h3>

  <p>The Yuen Peng McNeice Bromeliad Collection has been enhanced to emulate a mid-elevation Neotropical forest environment at 650m to 1,000m elevation. It showcases a selection of Neotropical plants such as bromeliads, aroids and Calathea species, as well as orchids. The 620m2 display house features key groups of plants from various bromeliad genera such as Ananas, Guzmania, Neoregelia, Tillandsia, Pitcairnia, Aechmea, Vriesia, Cryptanthus, etc, including both species and cultivars. In addition, orchids from the Neotropics are also featured, such as Cattleya,Epidendrum and Oncidium species and hybrids.  </p>
