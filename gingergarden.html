  <p>The Ginger Garden displays several hundred species of gingers and other plants from related families. With a walk behind a waterfall, romantic night lighting and a pool adorned with giant Amazon water lilies, the Ginger Garden has proven popular among visitors. </p>
  <p>The one-hectare Ginger Garden contains more than 250 species of members from the family Zingiberaceae and its relatives. Visitors are treated to a wide array of gingers in all shapes and forms, many with surprisingly beautiful leaves and very attractive flowers.</p>
  <p>The Ginger Garden has been divided into special zones where one can find gingers organised by their regions of origin.</p>
